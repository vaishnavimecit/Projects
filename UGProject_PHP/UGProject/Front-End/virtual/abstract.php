Virtual Password Authentication

In this paper, we discuss how to prevent users’ passwords from being stolen by adversaries in online environments and automated teller machines. We propose differentiated virtual password mechanisms in which a user has the freedom to choose a virtual password scheme ranging from weak security to strong security, where a virtual password requires a small amount of human computing to secure users’ passwords. The tradeoff is that the stronger the scheme, the more complex the scheme may be. Among the schemes, we have a default method (i.e., traditional password scheme), system recommended functions, user-specified functions, user-specified programs, and so on. A function/program is used to implement the virtual password concept with a tradeoff of security for complexity requiring a small amount of human computing. We further propose several functions to serve as system recommended functions and provide a security analysis. For user-specified functions, we adopt secret little functions in which security is enhanced by hiding secret functions/algorithms.
Index Terms—Codebooks, differentiated virtual passwords, key logger, phishing, secret little functions, shoulder-surfing.
