Virtual Password Authentication

The Internet has entered into our daily lives as more and more services have been moved online. Besides reading the news, searching for information, and other risk free activities online, we have also become accustomed to other risk-related work, such as paying using credit cards, checking/composing emails, online banking, and so on. While we enjoy its convenience, we are putting ourselves at risk. Most current commercial websites will ask their users to input their user identifications (IDs) and corresponding passwords for authentication. Once a user’s ID and the corresponding password are stolen by an adversary, the adversary can do anything with the victim’s account, which can lead to a disaster for the victim. As a consequence of increasing concerns over such risks, protecting users’ passwords on the web has become increasingly critical.
Users with important accounts on the Internet face many kinds of attacks, e.g., a user ID and password can be stolen and misused. The secure protocol SSL/TLS for transmitting private data over the web is well-known in academic research, but most current commercial websites still rely on the relatively weak protection mechanism of user authentications via a plaintext password and user ID. Meanwhile, even though a password can be transferred via a secure channel, this authentication approach is still vulnerable to attacks as follows: Phishing, Password Stealing Trojans and Shoulder Surfing. Many schemes, protocols, and software have been designed to prevent users from some specified attacks. However, to the best of our knowledge, so far, there is not a scheme which can defend against all the types of attacks listed above at the same time.
