    <p align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  CLOUD computing has been considered as a new model of enterprise IT 
    infrastructure, which can organize huge resource of computing, storage and applications, 
    and enable users to enjoy ubiquitous, convenient and on-demand network access to a shared pool 
    of configurable computing resources with great efficiency and minimal economic overhead. 
    Attracted by these appealing features, both individuals and enterprises are motivated to 
    outsource their data to the cloud, instead of purchasing software and hardware to manage the data themselves.Despite of the various advantages of cloud services, outsourcing 
        sensitive information (such as e-mails, personal health records, company finance 
        data, government documents, etc.) to remote servers brings privacy concerns. </p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The 
        cloud service providers (CSPs) that keep the data for users may access users’ 
        sensitive information without authorization. A general approach to protect the 
        data confidentiality is to encrypt the data before outsourcing. However, 
        this will cause a huge cost in terms of data usability. For example, the 
        existing techniques on keyword-based information retrieval, which are widely 
        used on the plaintext data, cannot be directly applied on the encrypted data. 
        Downloading all the data from the cloud and decrypt locally is obviously 
        impractical.</p>
