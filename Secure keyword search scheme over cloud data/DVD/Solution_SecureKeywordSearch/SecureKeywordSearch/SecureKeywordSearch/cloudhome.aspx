    <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
			<p align="justify" style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cloud computing is defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. Cloud computing is comparable to grid computing, a type of computing where unused processing cycles of all computers in a network are harnesses to solve problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.
In cloud computing, the word cloud (also phrased as "the cloud") is used as a metaphor for "the Internet," 
so the phrase cloud computing means "a type of Internet-based computing," where different services — such as servers, 
storage and applications — are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet. Deployment Model: Private Cloud, Public Cloud, Hybrid Cloud.<table

                    Cloud computing, or in simpler shorthand just &quot;the cloud&quot;, also focuses on 
                    maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources. Cloud resources are 
                    usually not only shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated 
                    per demand. This can work for allocating resources to users. For example, a 
                    cloud computer facility that serves European users during European business 
                    hours with a specific application (e.g., email) may reallocate the same 
                    resources to serve North American users during North America&#39;s business hours 
                    with a different application (e.g., a web server).  </p></td>
